# ArgoScuolaNext-API, build your PHP school projects with ease!

This project was built from scratch, but it was also hugely inspired by those other APIs built over Argo ScuolaNext:

- [ArgoAPI by Cristian Livella](https://github.com/cristianlivella/ArgoAPI) (Those APIs are kind of compatible with these ones)
- [ArgoScuolaNext by hearot](https://github.com/hearot/ArgoScuolaNext) (Those APIs are kind of compatible with these ones too)

So what's different with those APIs, you may ask?

- These APIs are simpler. I mean, really. No JSON tinkering, simple method calls, _it just works_.
- These APIs can store a session and recover it instead of using username and password every time _and that means security_.
- These APIs use PHP 7 and its features, _just because we love typehinting and return types_.

## Usage

Alright, so how do we use these APIs? Just look at these pieces of code, they are self-explanatory!

### Login

```php
<?php

const SCHOOL_CODE = "XX12345", USER = "someguy", PASSWORD = "somepass";

try{
	if(!is_file("session"))
		$argo->passwordLogin(SCHOOL_CODE, USER_NAME, PASSWORD, "session");
	else
		$argo->sessionLogin("session");
}catch(Exception $e){
	echo "Something happened: " . $e->getMessage();
	exit(-1);
}
```

### Example calls

Today's resume

```php
$oggi = $argo->oggi();

var_dump($oggi);
```

Yesterday's resume

```php
$ieri = $argo->oggi(strtotime("yesterday"));

var_dump($ieri);
```

Homework

```php
$compiti = $argo->compiti();

var_dump($compiti);
```
